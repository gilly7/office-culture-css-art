# Office Culture CSS Art

An interactive and visually rich CSS art project that recreates a modern office desk scene using only HTML and CSS. This project demonstrates advanced CSS techniques, creative use of gradients, flexbox, grid, and keyframe animations to bring an office environment to life—no images or SVGs, just pure CSS and HTML.

## Features

- **Fully CSS-based Art**: All elements (desk, monitor, keyboard, coffee mug, plant, sticky notes, lamp, stress ball, papers, pen holder, and more) are created using HTML and styled with CSS.
- **Animated Details**: Includes animated steam from the coffee mug, blinking avatars in a video call, pulsing mouse light, swaying plant leaves, flickering lamp, and more.
- **Responsive Layout**: The scene is centered and adapts to different screen sizes for a pleasant viewing experience.
- **No Images or SVGs**: 100% CSS and HTML—great for learning and inspiration.

## Preview

Open `index.html` in your browser to view the office scene.

## How It Works

- The main scene is structured in `index.html` using semantic divs for each object.
- All visual styling and animations are handled in `styles.css`.
- No JavaScript is required.

## Folder Structure

```
office-culture-css-art/
├── index.html      # Main HTML file with the office scene
├── styles.css      # All CSS art and animations
└── readme.md       # Project documentation
```

## Customization

- You can modify the scene by editing the HTML structure or tweaking the CSS for new objects, colors, or animations.
- Add your own sticky notes, change participant names, or adjust the desk accessories for a personalized touch.
